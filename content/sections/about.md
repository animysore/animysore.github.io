# About

I work in the algorithmic-trading division of Morgan Stanley - ever since after I graduated in the middle of the pandemic from PESIT Bangalore with a CS major.

Sometimes you can find me helping build [Turtlewig](https://turtlewig.com) - a tool for freelance designers.

My professional interests are in Software Development and Computer Science research - I am deeply enamoured by the elegant technical engineering behind great software products!   

I occasionally contribute to Open Source projects. I was a [Google Summer of Code 2019 (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5915487278465024/) student with [Red Hen Labs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4781629350871040/).

Community work has been a constant part of my student life, both in high school and as an undergrad when I was the [Lead of the Developer Student Club](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/animysore_dsc-pesit-newsletter-activity-6538434501511606272-KAW6).
