# About

I am a final year undergrad student at PESIT Bangalore, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am currently working on building a tool for freelance designers at [23ml](23ml.in) which I co-founded with [Gautam Padiyar](https://twitter.com/padiyar_) and [Sameer Kolhar](https://twitter.com/kolhar730) 2 years ago.

I passionate about software devolopment and research. I was a [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5915487278465024/) student with [Red Hen Labs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4781629350871040/).

I ❤️ communities - I was a [Developer Student Club Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/animysore_dsc-pesit-newsletter-activity-6538434501511606272-KAW6) and have organised dozens of talks and events.
