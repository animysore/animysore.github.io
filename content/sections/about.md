# About

I am a final year undergrad student at PESIT Bangalore, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

Currently, I am building a tool for freelance designers at [23ml](23ml.in) the company I co-founded with [Gautam Padiyar](https://twitter.com/padiyar_) and [Sameer Kolhar](https://twitter.com/kolhar730).

My professional interests are in Software Development and Computer Science research.

I occasionally contribute to Open Source projects. I was a [Google Summer of Code 2019 (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5915487278465024/) student with [Red Hen Labs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4781629350871040/).

Community work has been a constant part of my student life, both in high school and as an undergrad when I was the [Lead of the Developer Student Club](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/animysore_dsc-pesit-newsletter-activity-6538434501511606272-KAW6).
