# About

I am a CS researcher. I was formerly an engineer at Morgan Stanley, where I worked with HFT software.

I am fascinated by the elegant technical engineering behind great software products. I once led the development team at [Turtlewig](https://turtlewig.com) - a collaborative workflow tool for creative teams to manage digital assets.   

I occasionally contribute to Open Source projects. I was a [Google Summer of Code 2019 (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5915487278465024/) student with [Red Hen Labs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4781629350871040/).
