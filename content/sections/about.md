# About 👨🏽‍💻

I am a systems researcher. I was an engineer at Morgan Stanley, where I worked with platform infrastructure for low-latency/algo trading.

I am fascinated by the elegant technical engineering behind great software products. I was a co-founder of [Turtlewig.com](https://turtlewig.com), where I led the development team.

I frequently contribute to Open Source projects. I was a [Google Summer of Code 2019 (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5915487278465024/) student with [Red Hen Labs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4781629350871040/).
